# SpaceX Website Clone

HTML/CSS/JS SpaceX website clone project from the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wryPX7KSwSc). It is not the entire website, but the homepage, a few inner pages with the CSS animations, mobile menu and the JavaScript countdown effect.

It was a great project for learning CSS animations, mainly the counter one used for the number of landings and the one that turns the hamburger menu into an X and makes the rest of the page have a slightly dark overlay
